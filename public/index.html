                    <h3>Facts about plants</h2>
                        <p>Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes, forming the kingdom Plantae. Many are
                            multicellular. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not
                            animals,
                            and included algae and fungi. All current definitions exclude the fungi and some of the
                            algae.
                            By
                            one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin for "green plants") which
                            consists of
                            the
                            green algae and the embryophytes or land plants. The latter include hornworts, liverworts,
                            mosses,
                            lycophytes, ferns, conifers and other gymnosperms, and flowering plants. A definition based
                            on
                            genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae and the glaucophytes, in the
                            clade
                            Archaeplastida.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from
                            endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis using the pigment
                            chlorophyll,
                            which gives them their green colour. Some plants are parasitic and have lost the ability to
                            produce
                            normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize. Plants are characterized by sexual
                            reproduction
                            and alternation of generations, but asexual reproduction is also common.

                    <h3>Evolution</h2>
                        <p>There are about 382,000 accepted species of plants,[15] of which the great majority, some
                            293,000,
                            produce seeds.[16] The table below shows some species count estimates of different green
                            plant
                            (Viridiplantae) divisions. About 85–90% of all plants are flowering plants. Several projects
                            are
                            currently attempting to collect records on all plant species in online databases, e.g. the
                            World
                            Flora Online.[15][17]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plants range in scale from single cells, such as many algae including desmids (from 10
                            micrometres
                            across) and picozoans (less than 3 micrometres across),[18][19] to trees such as the conifer
                            Sequoia
                            sempervirens (up to 380 feet (120 m) tall ) and the angiosperm Eucalyptus regnans (up to 325
                            feet
                            (99 m) tall ).[20]

                    <h3>Evolutionary scenarios</h2>
                        <p>The ancestors of land plants evolved in water. An algal scum formed on the land 1,200 million
                            years
                            ago, but it was not until the Ordovician, around 450 million years ago, that the first land
                            plants
                            appeared, with a level of organisation like that of bryophytes.[34][35] However, evidence
                            from
                            carbon isotope ratios in Precambrian rocks suggests that complex plants developed over 1000
                            mya.[36]

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Primitive land plants began to diversify in the late Silurian, around 420 million years ago.
                            Bryophytes, club mosses, ferns then appear in the fossil record.[37] Early plant anatomy is
                            preserved in cellular detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert.
                            These
                            early plants were preserved by being petrified in chert formed in silica-rich volcanic hot
                            springs.[38]
